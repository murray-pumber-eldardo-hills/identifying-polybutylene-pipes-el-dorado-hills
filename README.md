# Identifying Polybutylene Pipes in El Dorado Hills

While once popular for their flexibility and low cost, polybutylene pipes are now known to fail prematurely, leading to leaks, water damage, and insurance issues.

## What Are Polybutylene Pipes?

Polybutylene is a gray or blue-gray plastic piping material commonly used for:
- Interior water supply lines  
- Main water service lines  
- Manufactured homes and tract housing developments  

Over time, PB pipes degrade when exposed to chlorine and oxidants in municipal water, causing **sudden pipe failure without warning**.

## What to Do If You Have Polybutylene Pipes

If polybutylene piping is confirmed:

1. **Do not attempt spot repairs** — failures are systemic  
2. Schedule a professional plumbing inspection  
3. Plan for a **full repipe** using PEX or copper  
4. Address the issue before selling or refinancing  

Early replacement is often far less expensive than water damage restoration.
