      <section aria-label="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Identifying polybutylene piping is a material-verification task focused on the potable water supply system. The objective is to determine whether legacy polybutylene (often abbreviated as PB) is present, where it runs, and how it connects to valves, fixtures, and transition points. This is typically performed as a diagnostic review rather than a repair activity.</p>
        <p>In El Dorado Hills, many residential neighborhoods were developed during eras when polybutylene was used in tract construction. Homes built with a mix of slab-on-grade and framed assemblies can limit visibility of supply runs, which elevates the value of careful verification at accessible points. Local water treatment characteristics and long-term use patterns also make accurate identification important for infrastructure planning and risk review.</p>

      <section aria-label="Key Terminology">
        <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
        <dl class="card">
          <dt>Polybutylene (PB)</dt>
          <dd>A flexible plastic piping material historically used for water supply lines; typically identified by color, texture, and printed markings.</dd>

          <dt>PB2110</dt>
          <dd>A common marking associated with polybutylene tubing, used as a field indicator during material verification.</dd>

          <dt>Compression Fitting</dt>
          <dd>A joint method often seen in older plastic supply systems; relies on mechanical compression rather than solvent welding.</dd>

          <dt>Transition Point</dt>
          <dd>A location where pipe material changes (for example, from PB to copper or another plastic), often concentrated near valves or equipment.</dd>

          <dt>Service Entry</dt>
          <dd>The point where the incoming water supply line enters the structure; frequently a practical place to confirm material type and continuity.</dd>

      <section aria-label="Process and Diagnostics">
        <h2>Process &amp; Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>Field identification is most reliable when it combines multiple signals: visible pipe material, printed markings, and the fitting ecosystem around joints and equipment. The review typically starts with accessible exposure points and expands outward to determine whether polybutylene is continuous through the home or limited to specific branches. Observations are then documented with context about construction constraints that may limit line-of-sight confirmation.</p>

        <p>Because polybutylene may appear in partial remodels or mixed-material systems, verification includes transition points near water heaters, valves, manifolds, and service entry areas. Where visibility is limited, documentation typically notes what can be confirmed directly and what remains inferred due to structural barriers.</p>

      <section aria-label="Technical Standards and Local Context">
        <h2>Technical Standards &amp; Local Context</h2>
        <p>Infrastructure expectations for water delivery, service connections, and system stewardship in the El Dorado Hills area are shaped by regional utility guidance and inspection practices. For formal reference material used in water and sewer system context, consult <a href="https://www.eid.org/">El Dorado Irrigation District standards and infrastructure guidance</a>.</p>
        <p>Any work that follows an identification finding is typically evaluated against permitting and inspection expectations applicable to El Dorado Hills and El Dorado County. Verification notes are commonly kept neutral and specific, focusing on what was observed and where, rather than inferring performance outcomes.</p>
